It is taped at Chelsea Television Studios in New York City. The show's 8th season premiered on September 9, 2013, and became the last Harpo show in syndication to switch to HD with a revamped studio. The concept behind this program showcases Ray's culinary skills. She brings various celebrities on screen to discuss their accomplishments in the entertainment, sports, and media industries. Ray asks for tips and strategies for staying healthy and safe from various health and lifestyle experts, she includes make-over segments, and features musical performances, all of which are features along the same lines of <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i>. She does, however, keep cooking in the forefront by including at least one cooking segment at the end of each episode, and sometimes inviting her celebrity guests to join her in the kitchen. According to Ray, \"People know me for my love of food, but I have so much more I want to share\". The set has the audience seated on a large turntable that rotates so that the audience can always see the \"action\" on the circular stage that surrounds them. At the end of each show, with the exception of a few more guests after Ray's cooking segments, Ray's tagline is, \"We'll see you when we see you\".</p>","updated":1512486245,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/9077"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1367977"},"nextepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1367978"}}},"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1367977"}}},{"id":1365679,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/1365679/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-2017-12-07-dec-7-2017","name":"Dec 7, 2017","season":2017,"number":137,"airdate":"2017-12-07","airtime":"12:00","airstamp":"2017-12-07T17:00:00+00:00","runtime":30,"image":null,"summary":null,"show":{"id":2129,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/2129/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire","name":"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire","type":"Game Show","language":"English","genres":[],"status":"Running","runtime":30,"premiered":"2002-09-16","officialSite":"http://millionairetv.dadt.com/","schedule":{"time":"12:00","days":["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday"]},"rating":{"average":null},"weight":74,"network":{"id":72,"name":"Syndication","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":69,"thetvdb":78236,"imdb":"tt0321019"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/11/29812.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/11/29812.jpg"},"summary":"<p>In <b>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</b>, 15 questions need to be answered by the contestants to win the 1 million dollar prize.</p>","updated":1512283562,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/2129"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1365679"},"nextepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1365680"}}},"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1365679"}}},{"id":1365200,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/1365200/the-young-and-the-restless-45x183-ep-11320","name":"Ep. #11320","season":45,"number":183,"airdate":"2017-12-07","airtime":"12:30","airstamp":"2017-12-07T17:30:00+00:00","runtime":60,"image":null,"summary":null,"show":{"id":4344,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/4344/the-young-and-the-restless","name":"The Young and the Restless","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Family","Romance"],"status":"Running","runtime":60,"premiered":"1990-01-01","officialSite":"http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_young_and_the_restless/","schedule":{"time":"12:30","days":["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday"]},"rating":{"average":9},"weight":93,"network":{"id":2,"name":"CBS","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":6318,"thetvdb":70328,"imdb":"tt0069658"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/20/51462.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/20/51462.jpg"},"summary":"<p><b>The Young and the Restless</b> revolves around the rivalries, romances, hopes and fears of the residents of the fictional Midwestern metropolis, Genoa City.

Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn't always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naïve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn't understand. Sheldon's mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn't fit in. Sheldon's older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it's tough to be cool when you're in the same classes with your odd 9-year-old brother. Finally, there's Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, who sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. For 10 years on THE BIG BANG THEORY, audiences have come to know the iconic, eccentric and extraordinary Sheldon Cooper.

Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and lest known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed The Colbert Report, which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time.
